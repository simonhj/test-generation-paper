\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a new domain specific language for
modeling business rules that can be used to capture functional
specifications of enterprise systems. Previously such rules would only
be expressed in prose. We also defined four well-formedness properties,
which can also be verified mechanically. To enable non-programmers 
such as business analysts to create models we
developed an Eclipse IDE prototype, where a user can create and refine
models in a guided fashion. The tool includes a semantic checker that
can verify well-formedness of a model.

We presented an algorithm that mechanically generates test sequences to
exercise rules in the model. The algorithm translates the rules in the
model into logical expressions and uses a constraint solver to infer
the needed input values. For optimization, the algorithm uses a novel
approach to prune the search space based on unsatisfiable cores. 

Our technique was evaluated using three models written in the
business rule language. These models were derived from business rules
written in prose. The results show that our algorithm, with the
optimization, is able to cover 99\% of all business rules. Furthermore,
the results also show that our optimization is a crucial component in
achieving full coverage.
