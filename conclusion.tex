\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have presented a new domain specific language for
modeling business rules that can used to capture functional
specifications of enterprise systems. Previously such rules would only
be expressed in prose. The language is amenable to tooling and We have
defined 4 well-formedness properties of the language that all can be
verified mechanically. To enable non-programmers to write models we
have developed an IDE prototype where a user can create and refine
models in a guided fashion. The tool includes a semantic checker that
can verify wellformedness of a model.

We present an algorithm that mechanically generates test sequences to
exercise rules in a model. The algorithm translates the rules in the
model into logical expressions and uses a constraint solver to infer
the needed input values. For optimization, the algorithm uses a novel
approach to prune the search space based on unsatisfiable cores. 

Our technique have been evaluated on three models written in the
business rule language. These models were derived from business rules
written in prose. The results show that our algorithm, with the
optimization, is able to cover 99\% of all business rules. Furthermore
the results show that our optimization is a crucial component in
achieving full coverage.
