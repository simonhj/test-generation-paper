At first blush, this problem seems to be reminiscent of the problem of generating tests for programs 
written as control-flow graphs, with the goal of exercising each acyclic path in the program, if
possible.  There have been a number of techniques in the literature for test generation. Mostly
notably, techniques such as \textit{concolic} testing attempt to identify a series of test data 
that would force program execution thorough different paths.  Other approaches are based on model
checking, with the goal of creating test inputs to reach specific program states.

However, the problem of test generation from business rules is different.  Business rules do not
describe the implementation of a system: rather they only describe a model.  (Model-based test 
generation?)
